## Other productivity tips
- Use Kali's default shortcuts to split the terminal (Ctrl+Shift+D / Ctrl+Shift+R), use tabs (Ctrl+Shift+T / Ctrl+Shift+W) and rename tabs (Alt+Shift+S).
- Create symlinks from common locations - like your webroot - to your main workspace to centralize management of these files and directories.
- Manage custom shell aliases and functions for common tasks.
- Use a clipboard manager like [CopyQ](https://hluk.github.io/CopyQ/) to work with clipboard history, fuzzy searching, and other awesome features.
- Create scripts for your C2 software to automate common tasks. For example, you can create a Metasploit [rc script](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Adversarial-Tradecraft-in-Cybersecurity/blob/main/Chapter3/auto_inject.rc) to automatically perform process injection.
